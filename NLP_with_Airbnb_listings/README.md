# Overview
This is a very common project, so there are similar projects to this. This was developed before my master's degree NLP (Text Mining) project with the purpose of acquiring and learning some of the practices that should be implemented in this field.

# Project Features

 - Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Implemented comprehensive text cleaning techniques including contraction expansion, emoji conversion, HTML tag removal, and tokenization
 - Text Representation Methods: Explored multiple embedding techniques including TF-IDF, Word2Vec (Skip-gram), GloVe, and RoBERTa contextual embeddings
 - Language Detection: Integrated language identification functionality to support multi-language text analysis
 - Text Normalization: Applied stemming and lemmatization with comparative analysis of different algorithms
 - Document Vectorization: Created sentence-level embeddings through various aggregation techniques
